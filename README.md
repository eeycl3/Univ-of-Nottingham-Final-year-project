# Univ-of-Nottingham-Final-year-project


A Electrical and Electronics Engineering Project related with SPI and I2C interfaces on Arduino and PIC 8-bit microprocessors.\n



There are two zip files about codes.

One is about using PIC to communicate with ADXL362(3-axis accelerometer), BME280(Humidity temperature pressure sensor), ADC,DAC.
The other one is about using Arduino to communicate the above sensors.

The thesis shows the result and discussions of the projects.
Hope this will help someone.

If you use the code and the report, please quote them!
